subtitle: Just sixty dollars and i felt guilty

That's what you get when you want to buy something. No matter what.

After visiting a caf√© and ordering coffee for sixty dollars I felt guilty.  After all, I could drink coffee at home and save a little bit of money.  

After the first, very successful year of running the company I bought a dream sports car.  Every time I got in it, I tortured myself for being expensive.  No wonder I didn't have much fun driving.... 

It is said that saving money is a good thing.  The problem arises when it evolves into stinginess.  A few years ago, I got myself into this state.  It took me a lot of effort to get out of it.
