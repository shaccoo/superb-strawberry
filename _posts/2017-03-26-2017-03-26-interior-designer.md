I earn above the national average, so I am disconnected from reality and have no right to talk about money. On the Internet it is a frequent accusation against me. Is it right?

Only a few years ago I had a total of five hundred zlotys in five accounts. In addition, not alone, but after summing up the "assets" of my wife and myself. What is important, we both worked as programmers at that time. Such a balance of accounts is not pleasant.  

Now let's move on to our student days. I remember the dilemmas under the title: "Beer or cigarettes?" because I couldn't afford the option of both. It became more drastic when Marilyn Manson's or Korn's album was released. Then for a month I became a forced man of culture, who just sat there and listened to music. Finally, I spent all my blackheads on it.

I couldn't always afford everything I needed. As they say, there was there, done that. 

Savings were useful (and even advisable!) when my budget was cut back. But when my income increased and my stinginess didn't go away, it became a burden to me.

I felt constant fear. What happens if I lose money? Is a financial cushion sufficient for a year of normal life adequate? Is it really a good idea to buy a car? Maybe I missed a good opportunity somewhere and spent too much?

These and other questions were on my mind and poisoned my life. To make me feel so guilty, all I had to do was buy a movie ticket, even though I could afford a hundred.
